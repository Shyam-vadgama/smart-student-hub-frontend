# Smart Student Hub API Guide

This document lists and describes all API endpoints defined in `server/routes.ts`.

- Base URL: relative to your server host, e.g. `http://localhost:<port>`
- JSON is the default request/response format unless stated otherwise.
- Authentication uses an HTTP-only cookie named `token` (JWT). See Auth section.
- Many routes require role-based authorization and additional domain checks.

## Conventions
- "Auth" indicates if the endpoint requires a valid JWT cookie. If Yes, include role constraints.
- Path params are shown as `:param`.
- Query params are provided after `?`.
- Types are illustrative. ObjectId is a MongoDB identifier string unless otherwise noted.

## LeetCode, Stock, Business (Mounted Routers)

These are mounted sub-routers. Refer to their respective files for full details:
- `app.use('/api/leetcode/problems', problemRoutes)` => LeetCode problems endpoints under `/api/leetcode/problems/*`
- `app.use('/api/leetcode/submissions', submissionRoutes)` => LeetCode submissions under `/api/leetcode/submissions/*`
- `app.use('/api/leetcode', badgeRoutes)` => Likely badge/stat endpoints under `/api/leetcode/*`
- `app.use('/api/stock', stockRoutes)` => Stock trading endpoints under `/api/stock/*`
- `app.use('/api/business/problems', businessProblemRoutes)` => Business problem endpoints under `/api/business/problems/*`

---

## Admin and Misc

### GET /api/analytics
- See Analytics section above (HOD only)

### GET /api/admin/compass
- See Admin section above (HOD only)

---

## Notes & Constraints
- Cookies: JWT token is set with `httpOnly`, and `sameSite` depends on environment. In production, `secure` and `sameSite='none'` are used.
- Many endpoints assume relationships between User, Profile, College, Department, Classroom, Subject, etc. Ensure these are created and linked properly.
- File uploads are stored locally and served via `/uploads/*` with authentication.
- Duplicate route definitions:
  - `/api/attendance/excel` appears twice with different middlewares; earlier registration typically wins precedence.
  - There is a route missing a leading slash: `GET api/faculty/:facultyId` intended for querying subjects by faculty. Use `/api/subjects/faculty/:facultyId` instead.

---
