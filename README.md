## 3. Detailed Functionalities & Real-Life Examples

### User Management & Authentication
The platform supports a hierarchical user structure with distinct roles: `shiksan_mantri`, `principal`, `hod`, `faculty`, and `student`. Each role has specific permissions and access levels.

*   **Registration & Login:** Users can register and log in securely using email and password. Passwords are hashed with bcrypt. JWTs are used for session management.
    *   **Real-Life Example:** A new student signs up for the platform, providing their name, email, and a password. Upon successful registration, they receive a JWT for authenticated access.
*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Middleware (`checkRole`) ensures that users can only access routes and perform actions permitted by their role.
    *   **Real-Life Example:** Only a `principal` can create a new `hod` account, and a `student` cannot access the `faculty` dashboard.
*   **User Creation by Authority:** Higher-level roles can create accounts for lower-level roles, often with auto-generated passwords and reset links.
    *   **Real-Life Example:** A `hod` creates new `faculty` accounts for their department, and the system sends a password reset link to the new faculty member's email.
*   **Password Reset:** Users can reset forgotten passwords via a token-based mechanism.
    *   **Real-Life Example:** A faculty member forgets their password, requests a reset, and receives an email with a unique link to set a new password.

### Academic Management
